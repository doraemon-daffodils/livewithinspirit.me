Welcome to my new site!

I've been meaning to create this site for a while now and after various distractions I've finally done it! In fact,
it only took me two days to have a fully working site, not bad, right?

Well here is a brief overview of how I did it. First things first, this site is built using [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) <vscode-icons-file-type-vue /> and the super fast
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) <vscode-icons-file-type-vite />. I generated the site using [Antfu's Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) to get a
solid baseline. With this I get the following out of the box:

- <twemoji-printer /> [Server Side Generation](https://github.com/antfu/vite-ssg)
- <twemoji-file-folder /> [File based routing](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages)
- <twemoji-mobile-phone /> [Zero-Config PWA Support](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-pwa)
- <twemoji-rocket /> [Markdown Support](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-md)

This is just a few of the features I get out of the box. For a more comprehensive list take a look at the [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse)
GitHub page. All of these features make it very easy to setup a blogging platform with just a little configuration. I took some inspiration
from [Antfu's Personal Site](https://antfu.me) where he has a very similar tech stack.

Anyway, I'll go more into depth about creating this site in later posts. Until then, thanks for stopping by <twemoji-grinning-face-with-smiling-eyes />

One more thing, if you'd like to take a look at the source code for this site you can [check it out here](https://github.com/wheatjs/wheatjs.me)
